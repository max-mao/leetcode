//A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively (0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].
//
//Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.
//
//Note:
//
//A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z). Note that x â‰  y and z > 0.
//Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.
//Example 1:
//
//Input:
//[[0,1,10], [2,0,5]]
//
//Output:
//2
//
//Explanation:
//Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
//Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
//
//Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
